# My Gym Site

This is a simple few page site for an idea I had a couple of years ago I recently found the mockup I created and decided to have a go and building a quick simple site with Gatsby. I wasn't sure about the images definitely better ways of dealing with them but I don't know enough Gatsby yet.

This is the result its far from perfect but a small project for some practice with Gatsby.

It is based on the default starter found <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/">here</a>
